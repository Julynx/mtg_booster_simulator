/**
 * Test suite intentionally removed.
 * The previous default CRA test asserted for a "learn react" link that does not exist,
 * causing false negatives and masking real regressions.
 *
 * If tests are reintroduced later, prefer a stable smoke test on App or key components,
 * mocking network calls and browser-only globals as needed.
