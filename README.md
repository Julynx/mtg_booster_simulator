When you enter the website for the first time, you'll receive $20 of simulated currency to purchase packs from the Store. You'll receive a free pack every 6 hours from that moment, no need to be online to claim it.

Click on a pack to open it, and enjoy the experience with rich animations and sound effects. Cards will glow depending on their rarity when you hover over them, and flip as you click them. Foil cards come to life with flowing waves of color.
